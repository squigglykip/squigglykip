ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kip â€” a data scientist and consultant with a knack for turning data into meaningful insights. I work at the intersection of data science, business intelligence, and automation, blending analytics with practical solutions that help organisations make better decisions.

I have experience across sectors like finance, health, fashion, and workforce planning, with recent projects focused on cultural analytics, workforce planning, and intelligent reporting. Youâ€™ll often find me building with tools like Power BI, Power Query, and Python, or tinkering with APIs to streamline workflows.

Currently diving deeper into machine learning, natural language processing and large language models, but always open to new challenges that connect data with real-world impact.

When I'm not working, I'm likely reading a fantasy series, learning something, or experimenting with tech. Feel free to check out my pinned projects and connect if youâ€™re into data, tech, or just good stories.
